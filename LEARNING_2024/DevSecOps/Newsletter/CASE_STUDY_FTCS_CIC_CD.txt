  BLOCKERS --
 
  1) Code was in ADO and other dependencies( prop file , certificates lib) were maintained in Application server. Disadvantage was there was no track of version for these dependencies.
  2) Redundancy - Some files were available in different locations. Overhead in maintaining.
  3) As the applications are legacy the manual builds were tightly coupled. Small change in any files required complete shutdown of entire application for 4 hours.
  4) Too much idle time and Waste - Unmodified code being built and deployed. 


  RESOLUTION
  
  1) Currently everything app code and other dependecies migrated to one place ADO.Eliminated the dependency of application server during build.
  2) Maintaining and versioning is now easy with GIT support.Redundancy is removed as we are maintaining at one place. Overhead is reduced.
  3) As build process is automated with the help of ADO build agents which reduced the waste and downtime of the applications.Individual projects CAN be built and delivered
  4) For any configuration changes(like database credentials, WSSO config changes,prop file etc) now entire application rebuilding is not required just restart is enough. It saves alot of downtime. 

  5) Build once and deploy in any higher environment.

  Future roadmap
   1) Hosting application in cloud (TAS platform) will help in elimating application server for deployment. Other cloud services we can leverage.
